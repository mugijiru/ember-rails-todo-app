Contributing to AMS
===================

First of all, **thank you**!

Now, for the details:

Please file issues on the [GitHub Issues
list](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/issues).

Please discuss new features or ask for feedback about a new feature [on
rails-api-core](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rails-api-core).

If you want a feature implemented, the best way to get it done is to submit a
pull request that implements it. Tests and docs would be nice.

Please include a CHANGELOG with all entries that change behavior.

:heart: :sparkling_heart: :heart:
